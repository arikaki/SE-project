# KORA

## Main theme:-
            It is a website which mocks Quora. A website to gain and share knowledge and ideas. This website is not limited to any particular technology and we can ask questions               and get real answers from people with different experiences.
            
            Elaboration on the project --
                   1. The focus is on providing a platform where anyone can ask the question and answer the questions providing a friendly environment for gaining knowledge and                         learn.
                   2. Answer recommendations-- Quora has developed its own proprietary algorithm to rank answers.
